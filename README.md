Lightweight Renderer, purposed to augment the development of Physicc

## Platforms

Platforms currently it compiles on:
* Windows 10
* Ubuntu 18

## Prerequisites

* cmake

### Windows

* mingw-w64 / VS 2019

### Ubuntu

* gcc
* X11

If you get library headers not found error while building, ```apt-get``` the dev version of all packages it requests you to install

```sudo apt install libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev```

### Mac

* XCode
* Cocoa
* IOKit

## Build Instructions

Recursive clone the git module

```git clone --recursive https://github.com/dropTableUsers42/Light```

### VSCode

If you have the [CMake tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools) extension, then simply select location as `Editor` folder, select kit as GCC/VS 2019, and build target as `Editor`

Hit Build

### On Terminal

* Change into directory

	`cd Light`

* Execute the following command

	`cmake --no-warn-unused-cli -HEditor -Bbuild -G"[Generator]"`

	Replace `[Generator]` with the compiler name you want to compile with, `MinGW Makefiles`/`Unix Makefiles`/`Visual Studio 16 2019`. The corresponding makefile/solution file is generated into `Light/build`

* If you want to build on terminal, execute

	`cmake --build build`

* If you want to build using Visual Studio 2019, just open the solution file generated

If you do not have a dedicated GPU (or drivers for the dedicated GPU eg. on Linux), you may need to run the following command on the terminal to setup the environment variables before running our program

`export MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=3.3`
